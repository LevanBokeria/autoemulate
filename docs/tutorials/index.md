# Tutorials

These are more in-depth workflows which cover all aspects of `AutoEmulate`, from comprehensive overviews of the features to strategies for minimising computation time with larger datasets or when using hyperparameter optimisation.

These tutorials are all Jupyter notebooks which can be [run in a local interactive session](../getting-started/installation.md#interactive-tutorials).
