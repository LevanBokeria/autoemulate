# AutoEmulate: An emulator platform for Digital Twins

AutoEmulator is a powerful and versatile tool designed to automate the complex process of emulating multiple machine learning models. It enables users to easily compare, optimize, and evaluate different models, making it an invaluable asset in the field of machine learning and data analysis.

Simulations of physical systems are often slow and need lots of compute, which makes them unpractical for applications like digital twins, or in situations where they have to run thousands of times, like sensitivity analyses. The goal of `autoemulate` is to make it easy to replace simulations with fast, accurate emulators. To do this, `autoemulate` automatically fits and compares lots of models, like *Radial Basis Functions*, *Gaussian Processes* or *Neural Networks* to find the best emulator for a simulation.
