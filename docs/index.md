# Welcome to AutoEmulate

> *Easily build efficient emulators for your simulations*

`AutoEmulate` is a Python library that makes it easy to create accurate, efficient emulators for simulations. Under the hood, it runs a complete pipeline to compare, cross-validate and optimise various models, abstracting away the need to manually tune hyperparameters and compare models. Whether you're working in scientific computing, engineering, or data science, `AutoEmulate` helps you create accurate, efficient surrogate models with minimal effort.

## ✨ Why AutoEmulate?

- 🛠️ **Rich Model Zoo**: From classic Radial Basis Functions to cutting-edge Neural Processes
- 🪄 **Low-Code**: Data-processing, model comparison, cross-validation, hyperparameter search and more in few lines of code
- 🎯 **Built for Emulation**: Optimized for typical emulation scenarios with small to medium datasets (100s-1000s of points) with many inputs and outputs
- 📊 **Emulator Applications**: Still early days, but we've got prediction, sensitivity analysis, history matching and more!
