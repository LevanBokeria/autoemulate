# AutoEmulate: An emulator platform for Digital Twins

`AutoEmulate` is designed to automate the complex process of emulating simulations with machine learning models. We often need emulators as drop-in replacements for complex physical simulations, which can be very slow and computationally expensive. The goal of `Autoemulate` is to make it easy to replace simulations with fast, accurate emulators. To do this, the package automatically compares, optimises, and evaluates a range of models, like *Radial Basis Functions*, *Gaussian Processes* or *Neural Networks* to find the best emulator for a simulation.
