# Emulators for complex simulations

`AutoEmulate` is a Python library that makes it easy to create accurate and efficient emulators for complex simulations. Under the hood, the package runs a complete machine learning pipeline to compare and optimise a wide range of models, and provides functions for downstream tasks like prediction, sensitivity analysis and calibration.
