# Getting started

Here, we'll show you how to install `AutoEmulate` and get started with the basics.

## ✨ Why AutoEmulate?

- 🛠️ **Diverse Emulators**: From classic Radial Basis Functions to cutting-edge Neural Processes
- 🪄 **Low-Code**: Data-processing, model comparison, cross-validation, hyperparameter search and more in few lines of code
- 🎯 **Optimized for Emulation**: Optimized for typical emulation scenarios with small to medium datasets (100s-1000s of points) with many inputs and outputs
- 🔌 **Easy Integration**: All emulators are `scikit-learn` compatible, and the underlying `PyTorch` models can be extracted for custom use
- 🔮 **Downstream Applications**: Still early days, but we've got prediction, sensitivity analysis, history matching and more
