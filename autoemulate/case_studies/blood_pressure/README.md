# Blood pressure simulation

In this workflow we demonstrate the integration of a cardiovascular simulator, specifically the Naghavi Model from the [ModularCirc](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ModularCirc) package, in an end-to-end AutoEmulate workflow.

In addition to `AutoEmulate`, running this notebook depends on having `ModularCirc` and `Jupyter` installed:

```bash
pip -r requirements.txt
```
