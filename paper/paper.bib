We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate multi-task learning in the context of Gaussian Pro- cesses (GP). We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a “free-form” covariance matrix over tasks. This al- lows for good ﬂexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assump- tion of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task trans- fer occurs. We evaluate the beneﬁts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks excel at function approximation, yet they are typically trained from scratch for each new function. On the other hand, Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer the shape of a new function at test time. Yet GPs are computationally expensive, and it can be hard to design appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a family of neural models, Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the beneﬁts of both. CNPs are inspired by the ﬂexibility of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are structured as neural networks and trained via gradient descent. CNPs make accurate predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to complex functions and large datasets. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of the approach on a range of canonical machine learning tasks, including regression, classiﬁcation and image completion.},

Because of their capability to deal with black-box problems and lower computational requirements, surrogates were successfully utilized by researchers in various engineering and scientific fields. An efficient use of surrogates can bring considerable savings in computational resources and time. Since literature on surrogate modelling encompasses a large variety of approaches, the appropriate choice of a surrogate remains a challenging task. This review discusses significant publications where surrogate modelling for finite element method-based computations was utilized. We familiarize the reader with the subject, explain the function of surrogate modelling, sampling and model validation procedures, and give a description of the different surrogate types. We then discuss main categories where surrogate models are used: prediction, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and surrogate-assisted optimization, and give detailed account of recent advances and applications. We review the most widely used and recently developed software tools that are used to apply the discussed techniques with ease. Based on a literature review of 180 papers related to surrogate modelling, we discuss major research trends, gaps, and practical recommendations. As the utilization of surrogate models grows in popularity, this review can function as a guide that makes surrogate modelling more accessible.},

	abstract = {In simulation-based realization of complex systems, we are forced to address the issue of computational complexity. One critical issue that must be addressed is the approximation of reality using surrogate models to replace expensive simulation models of engineering problems. In this paper, we critically review over 200 papers. We find that a framework for selecting appropriate surrogate modeling methods for a given function with specific requirements has been lacking. Having such a framework for surrogate model users, specifically practitioners in industry, is very important because there is very limited information about the performance of different models before applying them on the problem. Our contribution in this paper is to address this gap by creating practical guidance based on a trade-off among three main drivers, namely, size (how much information is necessary to compute the surrogate model), accuracy (how accurate the surrogate model must be) and computational time (how much time is required for the surrogate modeling process). Using the proposed guidance a huge amount of time is saved by avoiding time-consuming comparisons before selecting the appropriate surrogate model. To make this contribution, we review the state-of-the-art surrogate modeling literature to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the main classes of the design of experiment (DOE) methods, surrogate modeling methods and model-fitting methods based on the requirements of size, computational time, and accuracy? (2) Which surrogate modeling method is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? (3) Which DOE is suitable based on the critical characteristics of the requirements of size, computational time and accuracy? Based on these three characteristics, we find six different qualitative categories for the surrogate models through a critical evaluation of the literature. These categories provide a framework for selecting an efficient surrogate modeling process to assist those who wish to select more appropriate surrogate modeling techniques for a given function. It is also summarized in Table 4 and Figs. 2, 3. MARS, response surface models, and kriging are more appropriate for large problems, acquiring less computation time and high accuracy, respectively. Also, Latin Hypercube, fractional factorial designs and D-Optimal designs are appropriate experimental designs. Our contribution is to propose a qualitative evaluation and a mental model which is based on quantitative results and findings of authors in the published literature. The value of such a framework is in providing practical guide for researchers and practitioners in industry to choose the most appropriate surrogate model based on incomplete information about an engineering design problem. Another contribution is to use three drivers, namely, computational time, accuracy, and problem size instead of using a single measure that authors generally use in the published literature.},

Each function models the distribution of the output given an input, conditioned on the context. NPs have the benefit of fitting observed data efficiently with linear complexity in the number of context input-output pairs, and can learn a wide family of conditional distributions; they learn predictive distributions conditioned on context sets of arbitrary size. Nonetheless, we show that NPs suffer a fundamental drawback of underfitting, giving inaccurate predictions at the inputs of the observed data they condition on. We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled.},

	abstract = {Cardiac pump function arises from a series of highly orchestrated events across multiple scales. Computational electromechanics can encode these events in physics-constrained models. However, the large number of parameters in these models has made the systematic study of the link between cellular, tissue, and organ scale parameters to whole heart physiology challenging. A patient-specific anatomical heart model, or digital twin, was created. Cellular ionic dynamics and contraction were simulated with the Courtemanche-Land and the ToR-ORd-Land models for the atria and the ventricles, respectively. Whole heart contraction was coupled with the circulatory system, simulated with CircAdapt, while accounting for the effect of the pericardium on cardiac motion. The four-chamber electromechanics framework resulted in 117 parameters of interest. The model was broken into five hierarchical sub-models: tissue electrophysiology, ToR-ORd-Land model, Courtemanche-Land model, passive mechanics and CircAdapt. For each sub-model, we trained Gaussian processes emulators (GPEs) that were then used to perform a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to retain parameters explaining 90\% of the total sensitivity for subsequent analysis. We identified 45 out of 117 parameters that were important for whole heart function. We performed a GSA over these 45 parameters and identified the systemic and pulmonary peripheral resistance as being critical parameters for a wide range of volumetric and hemodynamic cardiac indexes across all four chambers. We have shown that GPEs provide a robust method for mapping between cellular properties and clinical measurements. This could be applied to identify parameters that can be calibrated in patient-specific models or digital twins, and to link cellular function to clinical indexes.},

	abstract = {Full scale aerodynamic wind tunnel testing, numerical simulation of high dimensional (full-order) aerodynamic models or flight testing are some of the fundamental but complex steps in the various design phases of recent civil transport aircrafts. Current aircraft aerodynamic designs have increase in complexity (multidisciplinary, multi-objective or multi-fidelity) and need to address the challenges posed by the nonlinearity of the objective functions and constraints, uncertainty quantification in aerodynamic problems or the restrained computational budgets. With the aim to reduce the computational burden and generate low-cost but accurate models that mimic those full order models at different values of the design variables, Recent progresses have witnessed the introduction, in real-time and many-query analyses, of surrogate-based approaches as rapid and cheaper to simulate models. In this paper, a comprehensive and state-of-the art survey on common surrogate modeling techniques and surrogate-based optimization methods is given, with an emphasis on models selection and validation, dimensionality reduction, sensitivity analyses, constraints handling or infill and stopping criteria. Benefits, drawbacks and comparative discussions in applying those methods are described. Furthermore, the paper familiarizes the readers with surrogate models that have been successfully applied to the general field of fluid dynamics, but not yet in the aerospace industry. Additionally, the review revisits the most popular sampling strategies used in conducting physical and simulation-based experiments in aircraft aerodynamic design. Attractive or smart designs infrequently used in the field and discussions on advanced sampling methodologies are presented, to give a glance on the various efficient possibilities to a priori sample the parameter space. Closing remarks foster on future perspectives, challenges and shortcomings associated with the use of surrogate models by aircraft industrial aerodynamicists, despite their increased interest among the research communities.},

	abstract = {Statistical models can be used as surrogates of detailed simulation models. Their key advantage is that they are evaluated at low computational cost which can remove computational barriers in building performance simulation. This comprehensive review discusses significant publications in sustainable building design research where surrogate modelling was applied. First, we familiarize the reader with the field and begin by explaining the use of surrogate modelling for building design with regard to applications in the conceptual design stage, for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and for building design optimisation. This is complemented with practical instructions on the steps required to derive a surrogate model. Next, publications in the field are discussed and significant methodological findings highlighted. We have aggregated 57 studies in a comprehensive table with details on objective, sampling strategy and surrogate model type. Based on the literature major research trends are extracted and useful practical aspects outlined. As surrogate modelling may contribute to many sustainable building design problems, this review summarizes and aggregates past successes, and serves as practical guide to make surrogate modelling accessible for future researchers.},

	abstract = {A global sensitivity analysis is performed to describe the effects of astronomical forcing on the climate–vegetation system simulated by the model of intermediate complexity LOVECLIM in interglacial conditions. The methodology relies on the estimation of sensitivity measures, using a Gaussian process emulator as a fast surrogate of the climate model, calibrated on a set of well-chosen experiments. The outputs considered are the annual mean temperature and precipitation and the growing degree days (GDD). The experiments were run on two distinct land surface schemes to estimate the importance of vegetation feedbacks on climate variance. This analysis provides a spatial description of the variance due to the factors and their combinations, in the form of "fingerprints" obtained from the covariance indices. The results are broadly consistent with the current under-standing of Earth's climate response to the astronomical forcing. In particular, precession and obliquity are found to contribute in LOVECLIM equally to GDD in the Northern Hemisphere, and the effect of obliquity on the response of Southern Hemisphere temperature dominates precession effects. Precession dominates precipitation changes in subtropical areas. Compared to standard approaches based on a small number of simulations, the methodology presented here allows us to identify more systematically regions susceptible to experiencing rapid climate change in response to the smooth astronomical forcing change. In particular, we find that using interactive vegetation significantly enhances the expected rates of climate change, specifically in the Sahel (up to 50\% precipitation change in 1000 years) and in the Canadian Arctic region (up to 3° in 1000 years). None of the tested astronomical configurations were found to induce multiple steady states, but, at low obliquity, we observed the development of an oscillatory pattern that has already been reported in LOVECLIM. Although the mathematics of the analysis are fairly straightforward, the emulation approach still requires considerable care in its implementation. We discuss the effect of the choice of length scales and the type of emulator, and estimate uncertainties associated with specific computational aspects, to conclude that the principal component emulator is a good option for this kind of application.},

	abstract = {In this proof-of-concept work, we evaluate the performance of multiple machine-learning methods as surrogate models for use in the analysis of agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing agent-based modelling outputs can be challenging, as the relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU time. Surrogate modelling, in which a statistical model of the ABM is constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare multiple machine-learning methods for ABM surrogate modelling in order to determine the approaches best suited as a surrogate for modelling the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process surrogates, currently the most commonly used method for the surrogate modelling of complex computational models. ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using machine-learning methods for surrogate modelling, as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation.},
