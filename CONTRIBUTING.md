## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, be it code, documentation, or community engagement. We encourage you to read through the following sections to learn more about how you can contribute to

## How to Submit Changes

We follow the same instructions for submitting changes to the project as those developed by [The Turing Way](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request). In short, there are five steps to adding changes to this repository:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by [forking the AutoEmulate repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/fork).
1. **Make Changes**: Ensure your code adheres to the style guidelines and passes all tests.
2. **Commit and Push**: Use clear commit messages.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Ensure you describe the changes made and any additional details.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Once you have [created a fork of the repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/fork), you now have your own unique local copy of AutoEmulate. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the main repository, otherwise, you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts).

If you prefer working with GitHub in the browser, [these instructions](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) describe how to sync your fork to the original repository.

### 2. Make Changes

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your pull request. Help them help you! :wink:

Are you new to Git and GitHub or just want a detailed guide on getting started with version control? Check out the [Version Control chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/version_control/version_control.html) in _The Turing Way_ Book!

### 3. Commit and Push

While making your changes, commit often and write good, detailed commit messages. [This blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters. It is also perfectly fine to have a lot of commits - including ones that break code. A good rule of thumb is to push up to GitHub when you _do_ have passing tests then the continuous integration (CI) has a good chance of passing everything. üò∏

Please do not re-write history! That is, please do not use the [rebase](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase) command to edit previous commit messages, combine multiple commits into one, or delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.

### 4. Open a Pull Request

We encourage you to open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible. This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on. It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).

GitHub has a [nice introduction](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) to the pull request workflow, but please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions :balloon:.

## First-timers' Corner

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with issues labeled as ["good first issue"](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22good+first+issue%22). These are typically simpler tasks that offer a great starting point.

There's also the label ["thoughts welcome"](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22thoughts+welcome%22), which allows for you to contribute with discussion points in the issues, even if you don't want to
or cannot contribute to the codebase.

If you feel ready for it, you can also open a new issue. Before you open a new issue, please check if any of [our open issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues) cover your idea already. If you open a new issue, please follow our basic guidelines laid out in our issue templates, which you should be able to see if you [open a new issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues/new/choose).

## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please open an issue here on GitHub to report it. We have a template for opening issues, so make sure you follow the correct format and ensure you include:

- A clear title.
- A detailed description of the bug.
- Steps to reproduce it.
- Expected versus actual behavior.

## Recognising Contributions

We value and recognise every contribution. All contributors will be acknowledged in the [contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/tree/main#contributors) section of the README. Notable contributions will also be highlighted in our sprint demo meetings.

AutoEmulate follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key) specifications. The all-contributors bot usage is described [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage). You can see a list of current contributors here.

To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request with the following:

> @all-contributors please add username for contribution1, contribution2

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid <contribution> types and examples of how this command can be run in [this issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues/94). The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

**PLEASE NOTE: Only one contributor can be added with the bot at a time!** Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one. Otherwise, you can end up with dreaded [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-conflicts). Therefore, please check the open pull requests first to make sure there aren't any [open requests from the bot](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/pulls/app%2Fallcontributors) before adding another.

What happens if you accidentally run the bot before the previous run was merged and you got those pesky merge conflicts? (Don't feel bad, we have all done it! üôà) Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`). If you are unable to do this for any reason, please <!-- let us know on Slack <link to Slack>--> reach out to us via email or open an issue, and one of our core team members will be very happy to help!

## Need Help?

If you're stuck or need assistance:

<!-- #TODO #148 - Check our [FAQ](<ADD LINK TO FAQ DOCUMENT>) section first. -->
- Reach out <!-- on Slack or --> via email for personalised assistance. (See ["Get in touch"](#get-in-touch) above for links.)
- Consider pairing up with a another contributor for guidance. <!-- You can always find us in the Slack channel and we're happy to chat! -->Contact us for guidance on this topic

**Once again, thank you for considering contributing to AutoEmulate! We hope you enjoy your contributing experience.**

## Inclusivity

We aim to make AutoEmulate a collaboratively developed project. We, therefore, require that all our members and their contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please familiarise yourself with our Code of Conduct that lists the expected behaviours.

Every contributor is expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct. It outlines our expectations and ensures a safe, respectful environment for everyone.
